# ClueProject
This is my final projerct from my Intro to Software Engineering course (CSCI 306), done in collaboration with another student, Hunter Thompson. 
This is a basic implementatiuon of the classic board game Clue, with a NASCAR twist on the names, weapons, and locations. The entirety of the project
is written in Java.
